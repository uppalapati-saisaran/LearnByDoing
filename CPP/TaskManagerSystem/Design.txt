C++ Task Manager Project from idea to blueprint.

1. Understand the Goal 

Objective: Build a Task Manager that can:

- Create, update, delete and list tasks.
- Execute tasks using threads.
- Schedule tasks using different algorithms.
- Log changes and events.
- Be easily maintainable ( SOLID + Design Patterns)
- Be testable (unit test support)

2. Define Core Entities ( Class Identification )

Use Noun Extraction to identity entities:

From requirements: "Task","TaskManager","Execution","Thread","Logger","Schedular","Storage"

So, probable classes: Task, TaskManager, Schedular, Logger, TaskExecutor, StorageManager 

3, Apply SOLID Principles to Responsibilities 

Task - Represents a single task (data only, no logic)

TaskManager - Manages task lifecycle ( create, update, delete, list, get)

Schedular - Provides scheduleing algorithm (FIFO, Priority, etc.) (Strategy Pattern)

TaskExecutor - Executes tasks ( multi-threaded )

Logger - Listens to changes and logs ( Observer Pattern )

StorageManager - Persists tasks (optional, could use File/DB)

Each class does one thing, satisfying Single Responsibilities Principle.


4. Define Key Relationships & Patterns 

Design Patterns

- Strategy Pattern : To plug in different scheduling strategies.
- Observer Pattern : Logger observes task status changes.
- Factory Pattern : Optional - to create Task objects cleanly.

Class Relationships:

- TaskManager owns Task objects.
- TaskExecutor uses scheduler to decide order.
- Logger subscribtes to TaskManager or TaskExecutor.

5, Defin Public Interfaces (Header-First Design)

Write .h files first to define contracts. Example:

// Task.h 
class Task {
public:
    Task(int id, const std std::string& name,int priority);
	void SetStatus(Status status);
	Status getStatus() const;
	int getPriority() const;
};


6, Sequence Diagram ( Example Flow)

User -> TaskManager : createTask() 
TaskManager -> Schedular: addTask()
TaskExecutor -> Schedular: getNextTask() 
TaskExecutor -> Task: run() [ no thread ]
Task -> Logger: notifyChange() 

7, Plan for Extension 

You may later want to add:

- REST API or GUI 
- Database Storage 
- Real-time updates Design now to make these pluggable 

Summary design steps:

1, Understanding goals and features.
2, Extract core entities (nouns)
3, Apply SOLID to assign class responsibilities
4, Choose design patterns for flexbility 
5, Define class relationships 
6, Create .h interfaces.
7. Think about future extensibility 


Continue C++ Task Manager Project 

ITask: Interface for all tasks ( SRP, ISP)

TaskManager: Core class using Singleton, handles task creation and execution.

ThreadPool: Manages threads (Concurrency) 

Process Manager: Manages child processes.

TaskFactory: Uses Factory Pattern to create tasks.

Schedular: Implements task scheduling algorithms (e.g., priority-based)

CLI : Uses Command Pattern for UI logic 


We can now begin implementing modules. I suggest proceeding like this:

Step 1: Define interfaces and base classes 

ITask - abstract interface for any task

ITaskFactory - for the factory pattern

ISchedular - interface for task scheduleing 

Step 2: Implement One Task Example 

- PrimeNumberTask - uses threading 
- Add status reporting and cancellation (SRP,OCP)


Step 3: Thread Pool

- Worker thread manager that picks tasks from a queue and runs them.

Step 4: Scheduler 

- Priority-based task scheduling logic (algorithm-focused)

Step 5: CLI Command Handling 

- Add, view, pause, resume, cancel tasks.
- Use command pattern
